##Download and install MIT's C++ port of E. Olson's AprilTags, [at](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/)

1. First we need to install *libv4l-dev* from the Ubuntu repositories

2. Now checkout AprilTags code from subversion to your favourite software directory:
    
    svn co https://svn.csail.mit.edu/apriltags

3. cd apriltags 

4. make  (don't run cmake)
If it does not finish due to OpenCV error its OK as long as libapriltags.a is generated.

5. Copy .h and library to /usr/local
sudo cp -r pod-build/include/* /usr/local/include
sudo cp -r pod-build/lib/libapriltags.a /usr/local/lib
