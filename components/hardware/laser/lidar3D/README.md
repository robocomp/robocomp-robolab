# Lidar3D
A brief introduction to the component. Describe its purpose, functionality, and any specific features here.
```
<YOUR BRIEFING>
```

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to build and run Lidar3D. Ensure they are installed and properly configured on your system before proceeding:
    - Install repo [rs_driver](https://github.com/RoboSense-LiDAR/rs_driver)
    - Install libopen3d-dev

## Run
Set ip of the running computer in config and in lidar, by accessing the lidar ip in a browser, section Setting.
    
The difference between lidars is the ports:
    Helios
    - MSOP = 6699
    - DIFOP = 7788
    Pearl
    - MSOP = 6698
    - DIFOP = 7787

## Starting the component
To avoid modifying the config file directly in the repository, you can copy it to the component's home directory. This prevents changes from being overridden by future `git pull` commands:

```bash
cd <Lidar3D's path> 
cp etc/config etc/yourConfig
```

After editing the new config file we can run the component:

```bash
cmake -B build && make -C build -j12 # Compile the component
bin/Lidar3D etc/yourConfig # Execute the component
```

# Developer Notes
This section explains how to work with the generated code of Lidar3D, including what can be modified and how to use key features.
## Editable Files
You can freely edit the following files:
- etc/* – Configuration files
- src/* – Component logic and implementation
- README.md – Documentation

The `generated` folder contains autogenerated files. **Do not edit these files directly**, as they will be overwritten every time the component is regenerated with RoboComp.

## ConfigLoader
The `ConfigLoader` simplifies fetching configuration parameters. Use the `get<>()` method to retrieve parameters from the configuration file.
```C++
// Syntax
type variable = this->configLoader.get<type>("ParameterName");

// Example
int computePeriod = this->configLoader.get<int>("Period.Compute");
```

## StateMachine
RoboComp components utilize a state machine to manage the main execution flow. The default states are:

1. **Initialize**:
    - Executes once after the constructor.
    - May use for parameter initialization, opening devices, and calculating constants.
2. **Compute**:
    - Executes cyclically after Initialize.
    - Place your functional logic here. If an emergency is detected, call goToEmergency() to transition to the Emergency state.
3. **Emergency**:
    - Executes cyclically during emergencies.
    - Once resolved, call goToRestore() to transition to the Restore state.
4. **Restore**:
    - Executes once to restore the component after an emergency.
    - Transitions automatically back to the Compute state.

### Setting and Getting State Periods
You can get the period of some state with de function `getPeriod` and set with `setPeriod`
```C++
int currentPeriod = getPeriod("Compute");   // Get the current Compute period
setPeriod("Compute", currentPeriod * 0.5); // Set Compute period to half
```

### Creating Custom States
To add a custom state, follow these steps in the constructor:
1. **Define Your State** Use `GRAFCETStep` to create your state. If any function is not required, use `nullptr`.

```C++
states["CustomState"] = std::make_unique<GRAFCETStep>("CustomState", period, 
                                                      std::bind(&SpecificWorker::customLoop, this),  // Cyclic function
                                                      std::bind(&SpecificWorker::customEnter, this), // On-enter function
                                                      std::bind(&SpecificWorker::customExit, this)); // On-exit function

```
2. **Define Transitions** Add transitions between states using `addTransition`. You can trigger transitions using Qt signals such as `entered()` and `exited()` or custom signals in .h.
```C++
// Syntax
states[srcState]->addTransition(originOfSignal, signal, dstState)

// Example
states["CustomState"]->addTransition(states["CustomState"].get(), SIGNAL(entered()), states["OtherState"].get());
states["Compute"]->addTransition(this, SIGNAL(customSignal()), states["CustomState"].get());

```
3. **Add State to the StateMachine** Include your state in the state machine:
```C++
statemachine.addState(states["CustomState"].get());

```

## Hibernation Flag
The `#define HIBERNATION_ENABLED` flag in `specificworker.h` activates hibernation mode. When enabled, the component reduces its state execution frequency to 500ms if no method calls are received within 5 seconds. Once a method call is received, the period is restored to its original value.

Default hibernation monitoring runs every 500ms.

## Changes Introduced in the New Code Generator
If you’re regenerating or adapting old components, here’s what has changed:

- Deprecated classes removed: `CommonBehavior`, `InnerModel`, `AGM`, `Monitors`, and `src/config.h`.
- Configuration parsing replaced with the new `ConfigLoader`, supporting both .`toml` and legacy configuration formats.
- Skeleton code split: `generated` (non-editable) and `src` (editable).
- Component period is now configurable in the configuration file.
- State machine integrated with predefined states: `Initialize`, `Compute`, `Emergency`, and `Restore`.
- With the `dsr` option, you generate `G` in the GenericWorker, making the viewer independent. If you want to use the `dsrviewer`, you will need the `Qt GUI (QMainWindow)` and the `dsr` option enabled in the **CDSL**.
- Strings in the legacy config now need to be enclosed in quotes (`""`).

## Adapting Old Components
To adapt older components to the new structure:

1. **Add** `Period.Compute` and `Period.Emergency` and swap Endpoints and Proxies with their names in the `etc/config` file.
2. **Merge** the new `src/CMakeLists.txt` and the old `CMakeListsSpecific` files.
3. **Modify** `specificworker.h`:
    - Add the `HIBERNATION_ENABLED` flag.
    - Update the constructor signature.
    - Replace `setParams` with state definitions (`Initialize`, `Compute`, etc.).
4. **Modify** `specificworker.cpp`:
    - Refactor the constructor entirely.
    - Move `setParams` logic to the `initialize` state using `ConfigLoader.get<>()`.
    - Remove the old timer and period logic and replace it with `getPeriod()` and `setPeriod()`.
    - Add the new function state `Emergency`, and `Restore`.
    - Add the following code to the implements and publish functions:
        ```C++
        #ifdef HIBERNATION_ENABLED
            hibernation = true;
        #endif
        ```
5. **Update Configuration Strings**, ensure all strings in the `config` under legacy are enclosed in quotes (`""`), as required by the new structure.
6. **Using DSR**, if you use the DSR option, note that `G` is generated in `GenericWorker`, making the viewer independent. However, to use the `dsrviewer`, you must integrate a `Qt GUI (QMainWindow)` and enable the `dsr` option in the **CDSL**. 
7. **Installing toml++**, to use the new .toml configuration format, install the toml++ library:
```bash
mkdir ~/software 2> /dev/null; git clone https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus.git ~/software/tomlplusplus
cd ~/software/tomlplusplus && cmake -B build && sudo make install -C build -j12 && cd -
```
8. **Installing qt6 Dependencies**
```bash
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev qt6-scxml-dev libqt6statemachineqml6 libqt6statemachine6

mkdir ~/software 2> /dev/null; git clone https://github.com/GillesDebunne/libQGLViewer.git ~/software/libQGLViewer
cd ~/software/libQGLViewer && qmake6 *.pro && make -j12 && sudo make install && sudo ldconfig && cd -
```
9. **Generated Code**, When the component is generated, a `generated` folder is created containing non-editable files. You can delete everything in the `src` directory except for:
- `src/specificworker.h`
- `src/specificworker.cpp`
- `src/CMakeLists.txt`
- `src/mainUI.ui`
- `README.md`
- `etc/config`
- `etc/config.toml`
- Your Clases...
